In Go




CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cpu_usage_summary_minute
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT host,
       time_bucket(INTERVAL '1 minute', ts) AS bucket,
       MAX(usage),
       MIN(usage)
FROM cpu_usage
GROUP BY host, bucket;



SELECT bucket, max, min
FROM cpu_usage_summary_minute
WHERE host = 'host_000001' AND bucket BETWEEN '2017-01-01 01:08:00+00' AND '2017-01-01 01:20:00+00'
ORDER BY bucket;
